# How To Install

<details>
  <summary><h2>Project setup</h2></summary>

  Due to Pizza Tower costing money, I have created a script which should prevent anybody from compiling and playing this build without owning a copy themselves.

  (OPTIONAL) Disable `Real-time protection` in Windows Security, since this is going to copy a large amount of files it is heavily recommended.

  1. Download the 0.8.2.0 release build for [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/releases/tag/0.8.2.0).

  2. Open the data.win file for Pizza Tower.

  3. Press the `Run other script...` button.

  4. Run `SpriteRipper.csx`, this will rip the sprites from the data.win file and add them to the GameMaker project.

  5. Select the `PizzaTower_GM2` project folder.

  6. Edit or remove the .gitignore file from the repository, this will allow you to commit the assets in git.
